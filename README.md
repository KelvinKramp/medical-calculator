# Medical calculator
Simple medical calculator based on the OPS assessment method. Used for medical drivers license examinations

The OPS has been developed and published in 2000 by Frederiec Withaar from the University of Groningen in the article “Divided Attention and Driving, the effects of aging and brain injury”. 

This repo contains an app written in Dash. You can use it to interactively calculate the OPS score.
